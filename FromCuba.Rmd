Hello EK, thanks for destroying my wife

Dan told me that you make poeple fitter every day!

Guess we'll find out next week ;)

Bring a good attitude and lots of energy!

Perhaps we should add everyone's stats to our website, add them as users/contributers (maybe with view-only - can we do that??) so that you can all compare your start and end results. Some people may not think that's a good idea though. Topic for discussion.

Don't forget to KNIT to create the webpage!!
